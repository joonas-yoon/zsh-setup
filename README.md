# zsh-setup

In macOS, I want to set up my terminal environment simply and then I wrote two scripts.

To set up zsh ternimal, just run the following two commands in a row:

```
$ source ~/.install-1.sh
$ source ~/.install-2.sh
```

`install-1.sh` is to install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), so if you already installed, you can skip this step.

`install-2.sh` do two things. one thing is to change prompt to display all directory path from `~`, and second one is to install [zsh-autocomplete](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete).

Happy Coding.
